# Motion Detection and Alert System

This project is a real-time motion detection system designed to monitor and alert users of any unusual activity. Utilizing OpenCV for video processing and motion detection, the system captures video from a camera and analyzes changes between frames. When significant movement is detected, it triggers an alarm and sends email notifications.

The alarm consists of an audible beep, which can be activated or deactivated via a simple user interface. Additionally, email notifications include images captured during the motion event, providing visual evidence of the detected activity. This system is ideal for home security and surveillance, offering both immediate auditory alerts and remote notifications to keep users informed of any potential intrusions.

Feel free to adjust any specifics to better fit your project's details!
